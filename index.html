<p>Stable Voronoi treemaps are a visually stunning way to create visualizations of large software systems that are under development. The visualizations have the following propperties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The visualization technique should produce pictorial representations of
  large software systems that allow the viewer to get a better understanding of the
  software systems.</li>
  <li>The visualization technique should be deterministic: it should produce the same pictorial
  representation for multiple runs on the same input data.</li>
  <li>The visualization technique should be versatile enough to allow the
  creation of pictorial representations of different aspects of the same
  software system.</li>
  <li>Pictorial representations of different aspects of the same software
  system should be similar enough to identify the same object with ease.</li>
  <li>Pictorial representations of different versions of the same software
  system should be consistent enough for the viewer to easily identify that it
  is in fact the same system that is being looked at, unless it has changed significantly.</li>
  <li>Pictorial representations of different versions of the same
  software system should allow the viewer to identify changes between the
  versions.</li>
  <li>The visualization technique should be able to create the pictorial
  representation with reasonable speed.</li>
</ul>
